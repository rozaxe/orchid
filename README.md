> A tiny CSS toolkit for building huge app.

- **unopiniated** only CSS class, nothing else ;
- **flexbox first** because it's the best ;
- **no _chichi_** or fancyness.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save r-orchid
```

## F.A.Q

### Oh no, Orchid does not match my whole use cases !

I know and that's okay ! Orchid was not build to be "everyone new favorite toolkit". It was designed by me and mainly for me to speed up my "app design" process so I can focus on User Experience and not on Design Experience.

If you found emptiness in Orchid, I highly encourage you to develop your own Design System !

### Why did you choose an hibiscus emoji ??

Well, there is no orchid emoji ! So it will be a hibiscus until then ðŸ™ƒ
